Description: A development release of MackCP, which offers an implementation of 
    Mack's estimator motivated by large exposure asymptotics in a compound 
    Poisson setting. This package provides actuarial tools for claims 
    reserving, loss development, and risk analysis. The methodology is based 
    on the research by Engler and Lindskog (2024), published in *ASTIN Bulletin*, 
    which motivates Mack’s estimator using large exposure asymptotics in a 
    compound Poisson setting (Engler & Lindskog, 2024). This release is under 
    active development, and future versions may introduce improvements and 
    new features as the package progresses towards a stable state.

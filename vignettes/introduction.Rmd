## Introduction

Mack's estimator is widely used in actuarial science for claims reserving, particularly within the chain ladder method. This vignette provides an overview of each function in the Mack estimator implementation, detailing its purpose, formula, code, and how it contributes to computing ultimate claims and reserves.

## 1. Incremental Claims Representation

The incremental claims representation is derived by computing the difference between cumulative claims at successive development periods. This helps in tracking claims progression over time.

### Formula

The formula for incremental claims is:
\[
\Delta C_{i,t} = C_{i,t} - C_{i,t-1}
\]
where \( C_{i,t} \) is the cumulative claim amount for accident year \( i \) at development period \( t \).

### Code

```R
incremental_claims <- function(cumulative_claims) {
  diff(cumulative_claims, lag = 1, differences = 1)
}
```

### Explanation

The `incremental_claims` function calculates the difference between cumulative claims in successive periods. This is important for breaking down cumulative data into incremental claims, which are more informative for examining claims patterns and development.

## 2. Compound Poisson Process Representation

The compound Poisson process models the total claim amount as the sum of individual claim severities. This is often used when modeling aggregate claims for a given number of claims.

### Formula

For \( N \) claims and severities \( Z_j \), the total claims amount \( S \) is given by:
\[
S = \sum_{j=1}^{N} Z_j
\]

### Code

```R
compound_poisson_claims <- function(num_claims, claim_severities) {
  sum(claim_severities[1:num_claims])
}
```

### Explanation

This function calculates the total claim amount by summing the severities of all claims up to a specified number. This approach models total claim amounts as a compound Poisson process, which is widely used in actuarial models for aggregate claims.

## 3. Chain Ladder Expectation

The chain ladder method estimates future claims based on historical claims and development factors. The expected cumulative claim amount at development period \( t+1 \) is given by the development factor \( f_t \) multiplied by the cumulative claim amount \( C_{i,t} \) at the previous development period.

### Formula

The chain ladder expectation formula is:
\[
E[C_{i,t+1}] = f_t \cdot C_{i,t}
\]

### Code

```R
chain_ladder_expectation <- function(f_t, C_it) {
  f_t * C_it
}
```

### Explanation

This function provides an estimate of expected claims at the next development period using the chain ladder approach. This method relies on the assumption that future claims development is proportional to historical claims at each period.

## 4. Chain Ladder Variance

The variance of the chain ladder estimate is calculated to assess the uncertainty in future claims estimates. The variance formula uses the development factor variance parameter \( \sigma_t^2 \) and cumulative claims amount \( C_{i,t} \).

### Formula

\[
\text{Var}(C_{i,t+1}) = \sigma_t^2 \cdot C_{i,t}
\]

### Code

```R
chain_ladder_variance <- function(sigma_t_squared, C_it) {
  sigma_t_squared * C_it
}
```

### Explanation

The `chain_ladder_variance` function calculates the variance of future claims based on historical claims. Variance is crucial for evaluating the risk associated with estimated reserves and provides a measure of predictive accuracy.

## 5. Development Factor Estimation

The development factor for each period is estimated by calculating the ratio of cumulative claims across periods. This factor is fundamental in the chain ladder method, projecting cumulative claims into the future.

### Formula

The development factor \( f_t \) is estimated as:
\[
f_t = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n-t} C_{i,t+1}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n-t} C_{i,t}}
\]

### Code

```R
development_factor_estimate <- function(claims_triangle, t) {
  numerator <- sum(claims_triangle[1:(nrow(claims_triangle) - t), t + 1], na.rm = TRUE)
  denominator <- sum(claims_triangle[1:(nrow(claims_triangle) - t), t], na.rm = TRUE)
  if (denominator == 0) return(NA)
  numerator / denominator
}
```

### Explanation

This function estimates the development factor \( f_t \) for each development year. Development factors are essential in projecting cumulative claims forward, allowing for the completion of the claims triangle.

## 6. Mack’s Conditional Mean Squared Error (MSE) of Prediction

Mack's estimator includes an MSE calculation for each cell in the claims triangle, helping assess the accuracy of predictions.

### Formula

The MSE formula is:
\[
\text{MSE}(C_{i,t+1}) = \frac{\sigma_t^2}{f_t^2} \left( \frac{1}{C_{i,t}} + \frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} C_{j,t}} \right)
\]

### Code

```R
conditional_mse_prediction <- function(sigma_t_squared, f_t, C_it, claims_triangle, t) {
  if (C_it == 0 || f_t == 0) return(NA)
  term1 <- sigma_t_squared / (f_t^2)
  term2 <- 1 / C_it
  term3 <- 1 / sum(claims_triangle[, t], na.rm = TRUE)
  term1 * (term2 + term3)
}
```

### Explanation

The function calculates MSE for each cell, capturing prediction uncertainty. By quantifying error, actuaries can gauge the reliability of estimates for future claims and reserves.

## 7. Asymptotic Development Factor Limit

The asymptotic development factor represents the ratio of successive expected claim amounts at large exposures, providing insight into long-term claim behavior.

### Formula

\[
\lim_{t \to \infty} f_t = \frac{\text{E}(Z_{t+1})}{\text{E}(Z_t)}
\]

### Code

```R
asymptotic_development_factor_limit <- function(expected_Z_t_plus1, expected_Z_t) {
  if (expected_Z_t == 0) return(NA)
  expected_Z_t_plus1 / expected_Z_t
}
```

### Explanation

The asymptotic limit is useful in scenarios with large exposure, indicating the steady-state development factor. This function calculates the ratio of expected claims, aiding in long-term reserve calculations.

## 8. Variance Parameter Estimation

The variance parameter \( \sigma_t^2 \) is estimated to assess the volatility of claim development across periods.

### Formula

\[
\sigma_t^2 = (f_t - 1) \left( \frac{\text{E}(Z_{t+1}^2)}{\text{E}(Z_{t+1})} + (f_t - 1) \frac{\text{E}(Z_t^2)}{\text{E}(Z_t)} \right)
\]

### Code

```R
variance_parameter_estimate <- function(f_t, expected_Z_squared_t_plus1, expected_Z_t_plus1, expected_Z_squared_t, expected_Z_t) {
  if (expected_Z_t_plus1 == 0 || expected_Z_t == 0) return(NA)
  (f_t - 1) * (expected_Z_squared_t_plus1 / expected_Z_t_plus1 + (f_t - 1) * expected_Z_squared_t / expected_Z_t)
}
```

### Explanation

This function provides an estimate for the variance parameter, reflecting the variation in claim development. Estimating \( \sigma_t^2 \) allows for calculating prediction intervals and assessing reserve adequacy.

## 9. Extend Triangle to Full Rectangle (Ultimate Claims Calculation)

The final function completes the claims triangle to a full rectangle by estimating claims in the unobserved triangle section.

### Code

```R
complete_rectangle <- function(claims_triangle, development_factors) {
  n_accident_years <- nrow(claims_triangle)
  n_dev_years <- ncol(claims_triangle)
  
  for (i in 1:n_accident_years) {
    for (t in (n_dev_years - i + 1):n_dev_years) {
      claims_triangle[i, t] <- claims_triangle[i, t - 1] * development_factors[t - 1]
    }
  }
  claims_triangle
}
```

### Explanation

The `complete_rectangle` function estimates claims for the entire claims rectangle, projecting ultimate claims beyond the original triangle. This step is critical in actuarial reserving, as it provides estimates for claims that have not yet fully developed.

## Conclusion

This vignette provides a detailed overview of eachfunction in Mack's estimator implementation, explaining their purpose, formulas, code, and significance in claims reserving. By following this approach, actuaries can project future claims development, assess reserve adequacy, and quantify prediction uncertainty. Mack's method remains a cornerstone in actuarial practice, and the tools provided in this package offer a systematic way to implement it.

### Complete Example of Using Mack’s Estimator

The following code provides a complete example of how to use these functions to calculate Mack's estimator for claims reserving, using simulated claims data.

```R
# Load required libraries
library(stats)

# Simulate claims triangle data
set.seed(2)
claims_triangle <- matrix(NA, nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
for (i in 1:10) {
  claims_triangle[i, 1:(11 - i)] <- cumsum(runif(11 - i, min = 100, max = 500))
}

# Run Mack's estimator function to compute development factors, variance estimates, and more
result <- mack_estimator(claims_triangle)

# Display results
print("Development Factors:")
print(result$development_factors)

print("Variance Estimates:")
print(result$variance_estimates)

print("MSE Prediction:")
print(result$mse_prediction)

print("Completed Rectangle (Ultimate Predictions):")
print(result$completed_rectangle)

if (!is.null(result$asymptotic_limits)) {
  print("Asymptotic Development Factor Limits:")
  print(result$asymptotic_limits)
}
```

### Explanation of Results

1. **Development Factors**: These values are estimated from the claims triangle and are used to project claims into the future. They provide insight into how claims develop over time for each development year.
  
2. **Variance Estimates**: Variance estimates help quantify the uncertainty in the claims projections. Higher variance indicates more uncertainty in the reserve estimate for that period.

3. **MSE Prediction**: The Mean Squared Error of prediction quantifies the error associated with each claim estimate in the triangle. It is essential for evaluating the accuracy of the projections and for determining reserve confidence intervals.

4. **Completed Rectangle**: This is the fully developed claims rectangle, with ultimate predictions extending beyond the initial triangle. The completed rectangle provides the final reserves needed for all outstanding claims.

5. **Asymptotic Development Factor Limits**: If severity data is available, this provides the asymptotic ratio between successive development factors, giving insight into long-term claims behavior.

### Practical Applications

Using Mack's estimator, actuaries can:

- **Estimate reserves** for outstanding claims accurately.
- **Evaluate risk and uncertainty** by calculating prediction variances.
- **Determine ultimate losses** by completing the claims rectangle.
- **Assess long-term behavior** in claims development with asymptotic limits.

These functions and calculations are essential tools for actuaries in assessing the adequacy of reserves, predicting future liabilities, and ensuring the financial stability of insurance portfolios.

## Conclusion

This vignette has provided a comprehensive guide to implementing and using Mack’s estimator for claims reserving in an actuarial context. By applying these functions, users can efficiently analyze and predict claim development patterns, helping insurers make informed reserving and financial decisions.
